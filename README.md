As building ecommerce website has alot of work so we have divided 
whole project into 3 flows-

**Flow #1-**
1. Homepage showing all products (title and description), showing product by specific category
2. User Registration, Login, Logout
3. Product landing page - clicking on any item on homepage which will take on another webpage having specific product details
4. Category Specific page - clicking on category name on homepage will take to webpage showing all products of clicked category product 
5. Adding items to cart
